Considerations made for application

It does the word game as described in the assessment.

Architecture chosen: MVVM
Language: Swift, SwiftUI (Very new to this but want to start to get into it - not many projects using it yet but slowly creeping in.)

Persistance: UserDefaults(Not secure at all and not a backend database - apologies for this.)
